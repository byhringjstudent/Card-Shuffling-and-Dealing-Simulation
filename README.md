# Card-Shuffling-and-Dealing-Simulation

This project leverages object-oriented principles to simulate a deck of cards, encapsulating internal data representation and 
employing name mangling for simulating private attributes. The DeckOfCards class provides features for shuffling, dealing, 
and visualizing cards using Matplotlib, demonstrating a robust and interactive card game simulation.

This version includes:

    Object-oriented principles: Explicitly mentions the use of object-oriented programming.
    Internal data representation: Highlights the encapsulation of data within the DeckOfCards class.
    Name mangling: Shows awareness of this technique for simulating private attributes.
    Feature creation of class: Mentions shuffling, dealing, and visualization as features of the class.
    Robust and interactive: Emphasizes the quality and interactivity of the simulation.
